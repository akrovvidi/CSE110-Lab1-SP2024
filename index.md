## Introduction
Hello, My name is **Aniruddh Krovvidi**, and I am a second-year CS major. 
One of my main mottos in life is the following:
> Hardwork beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.


I still remember, to date, the first-ever line I executed: 'System.out.println("Hello World!");'
The day I decided to be a software engineer, lol.
During my early stages as a Java programmer, I remember constantly referring to this website: [Java Syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_syntax.asp).
A bit about me as an indiviudal is I love sports and cars. Here is a list of sports I enjoy watching:
- Football
* Cricket
+ Formula 1

And, these are my favorite car brands ranked:
1. Mercedes Benz (obviously because of the G-Wagen)
2. Rolls-Royce
3. Brabus

This is what my daily routine looks like:
- [ ] Brush Teeth
- [ ] Eat
- [x] No shower [gotta continue the CS major stereotype :)]
